## Is this useful for me ?

If you are starting with a react project and using firebase as backend. You might find this useful as a good starting point. Its a complete scaffolding with all required components.

## This project includes

- react-router-dom
- firebase

## Instructions

- Clone this project into your machine.
- Create a firebase project in your firebase account.
- Copy the configurations to [src/config](src/config.js)
- Or create a env file in root and add the required env vars for config.

## Run it as

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i
# For using emulators initialize your project with firebase-cli
firebase init

# start firebase emulators
npm run emu

# Start the server
npm start
```
